# Overview
Implementation of an optimised Neural Network in C from scratch. 
(Project currently in progress)

# Files
`main.c` - Main file for testing, and implementing the neural network later on.

`matrix.h` - A C library meant to substitute as a simpler numpy library. 

`parse_csv.h` - A C library used to convert a csv data file into a useable `matrix_t` format.

`data/mnist_train|test_data.csv` - Csv files for training and testing the mnist dataset. These datasets are smaller than the full mnist dataset, due to github file size restrictions.
